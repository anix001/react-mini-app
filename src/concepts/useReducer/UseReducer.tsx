//HOOKS DEF: In React, hooks are special functions that allow developers to use state and other React features within
//  functional components without needing to write class components.

//Definition: This hook gives us an easy way to organize our state management.

//This hook is like useState but with additions features, you can think of this as a superset of useState,

//Syntax: const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init?)

//Reducer: A reducer is simply a function, a pure function that takes the previous state as the first parameter and 
// action as the second parameter, and returns a new state based on the act passed.

//initialArg: The value from which the initial state is calculated.

//optional init: The initializer function that should return the initial state. If itâ€™s not specified, the initial state is set to initialArg. 
// Otherwise, the initial state is set to the result of calling init(initialArg).


//useReducer returns an array with exactly two items:

//The current state of this state variable, initially set to the initial state you provided.
//The dispatch function that lets you change it in response to interaction.
